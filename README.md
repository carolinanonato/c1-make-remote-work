# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

This is my first take on a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5) project, a phenomenal website with professional web designs that we need to build looking close as possible. This challenge tested my ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites, and also a cool looking mobile version! This took me 3 days, roughly 10 hours to complete.
